# TestTabBarLibrary

This project will allow developer to integrate a Tab Bar into their own project.
 - They can define the color,
 - the number of items (and their width and heigth),
 - if they want to have a search feature or not,
 - if they want their Tab Bar to be at the top, the bottom, the right or the left of the screen.
 - And if they want to much items for the screen, a 'more' item will allow them to access the items that cannot be directly on the Tab Bar.
